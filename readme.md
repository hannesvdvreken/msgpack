## What is Msgpack?

If you ever wished to use JSON for convenience (storing an image with metadata)
but could not for technical reasons (encoding, size, speed...), MessagePack is a perfect replacement.

MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format.
It lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON.
But it's faster and smaller.
Small integers are encoded into a single byte,
and typical short strings require only one extra byte in addition to the strings themselves.

## Usage

There are 2 main classes with basic static methods to use:

```php
    $encoder = new Msgpack\Encoder;
    $string = $encoder->encode($data);

    $decoder = new Msgpack\Decoder;
    $data = $decoder->decode($string);
```

Some messages or encoded string throw exceptions because Msgpack has its limitations:

```php
    try {
        $string = $encoder->encode($data);
    } catch (Msgpack\UnencodeableException $unencex) {
        //
    }
```

```php
    try {
        $string = $decoder->decode($string);
    } catch (Msgpack\UndecodeableException $undecex) {
        //
    }
```

## Testing

Run test with `composer test`.

## Other packages

This is [not the first](https://packagist.org/search/?q=msgpack) packagist package on msgpack,
but it is the first that is not an RPC client for the Msgpack cli tool. This package doesn't require
any external non-php libraries to be installed. The [default Msgpack library](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-php)
is a PECL library, so not so interesting to install.
